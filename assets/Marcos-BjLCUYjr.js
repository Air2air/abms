Costin, a former de Havilland engineer, brought aviation-inspired plywood monocoque chassis to the marque’s early cars, starting with the quirky Xylon. Relocating to Bradford on Avon in 1963 and a purpose-built Westbury factory in 1971, Marcos produced lightweight sports cars like the 1964 GT 1800, famed for its sleek design. Financial struggles, particularly with U.S. exports, led to liquidation in 1971. Marsh revived the marque in 1976, relaunching the GT in 1981 as a kit car. Despite further bankruptcies in 2000 and 2007, Marcos’ resilient spirit endured, with Rory McMath’s Marcos Heritage Spares ensuring parts support.

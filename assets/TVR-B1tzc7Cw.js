Known for powerful engines and visceral driving experiences, TVR produced iconic models like the Griffith, Tuscan, and Cerbera. Ownership changed hands—Martin Lilley (1965–1981), Peter Wheeler (1981–2004), and Nikolai Smolensky (2004–2013)—with production peaking in the 1990s as Britain’s largest independent sports car maker.

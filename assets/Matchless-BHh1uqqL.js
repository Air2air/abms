Matchless rose to prominence with Charlie Collier’s 1907 Isle of Man TT victory, establishing it as a leading British motorcycle firm. By 1938, it joined Associated Motorcycles (AMC), merging with AJS, and later absorbed brands like Norton. Matchless produced a wide range, from 250cc two-strokes to 750cc four-stroke twins, until production ceased in 1966 due to financial struggles and Japanese competition.

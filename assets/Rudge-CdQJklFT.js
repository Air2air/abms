Based in Coventry, the marque quickly gained a reputation for innovative engineering and racing prowess.

By the 1920s, Rudge was a leader in British motorcycle manufacturing, with models like the Ulster, named after Graham Walker’s 1928 Ulster Grand Prix win. Despite financial struggles during the Great Depression, Rudge produced motorcycles until 1939, when World War II shifted the factory to radar production under EMI ownership. Post-war, limited stock was sold off by 1946, marking the end of production. The marque’s legacy endures through the Rudge Enthusiasts Club, founded in 1956, which preserves its history.

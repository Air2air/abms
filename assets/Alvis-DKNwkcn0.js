Renamed Alvis Ltd. in 1936, the company expanded into aero-engines and armored vehicles. Car production ceased in 1967 after Rover’s acquisition in 1965, with only 109 TF 21 models sold due to high costs and industry challenges.

Alvis also introduced independent front suspension in the UK, improving ride quality and handling. The 1923 12/50’s overhead-valve engine, with aluminum pistons and pressure lubrication, delivered robust performance for its era. These innovations, led by chief engineer G.T.

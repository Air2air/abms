The 1920s saw steady growth with models like the AC Six, but financial struggles led to multiple ownership changes, including the Hurlock brothers’ acquisition in 1930. AC Cars gained fame with the Ace and Cobra in the 1950s–1960s, the latter developed with Carroll Shelby. Production slowed in the 1980s, with brief revivals under Brian Angliss.

The 1962 AC Cobra’s marriage of a lightweight Ace chassis with a Ford V8 engine, producing up to 425 bhp, set a benchmark for power-to-weight ratios, achieving 0–60 mph in under 4.5 seconds.

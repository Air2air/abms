            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Jensen Motors, founded in 1934 by brothers Alan and Richard Jensen in West Bromwich, England, began as a coachbuilder crafting bespoke bodies for Austin and Standard chassis. The 1936 S-Type, a Ford V8-powered convertible, marked their first complete car. Post-World War II, Jensen produced luxury saloons like the PW and iconic grand tourers, including the Interceptor. Partnering with Ford, Austin, and Chrysler for engines, Jensen focused on innovative designs. Financial struggles led to receivership in 1976, but the marque’s legacy endures, as chronicled by the <a href="https://jensenmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jensen Museum</a>.</p>
            <p>During the war, Jensen contributed to military production, later diversifying into commercial vehicles under the JNSN marque. Its hand-built approach ensured exclusivity but limited scale, appealing to enthusiasts seeking distinctive British cars. The 1960s and 1970s saw Jensen’s peak with models like the C-V8 and Interceptor, though the 1973 oil crisis exacerbated financial woes.</p>

            <h3>Engineering Innovations and Technical Milestones</h3>
            <p>Jensen’s 1966 FF introduced the world’s first production all-wheel-drive system and Dunlop Maxaret anti-lock brakes, originally developed for aircraft. This technology, detailed by the <a href="https://joc.org.uk/models/jensen-ff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jensen Owners’ Club</a>, enhanced traction and safety, predating modern systems by over a decade.</p>
            <p>The 1953 Jensen 541 pioneered fiberglass bodywork, reducing weight and improving aerodynamics. Its adjustable grille optimized high-speed performance. The 1962 C-V8, powered by a Chrysler V8, achieved 0–60 mph in 6.7 seconds, among the fastest four-seaters of its time. Italian styling from Carrozzeria Touring for the 1966 Interceptor blended British engineering with continental elegance.</p>

            <h3>Great Racing Achievements and Drivers</h3>
            <p>Jensen’s racing record, while modest, included notable efforts. In 1953, rally driver Ralph Sleigh competed in the Monte Carlo Rally with an Interceptor Saloon, showcasing durability, as noted in <a href="https://jensenmuseum.org/history-and-heritage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jensen Museum archives</a>.</p>
            <p>Privateers like Ian Northeast later highlighted Jensen’s potential. While most racing was grassroots, enthusiasts leveraged the marque’s powerful Chrysler engines in sprints and hill climbs, cementing a niche motorsport presence.</p>

            <h3>Racing Rivalries and Motorsport Legacy</h3>
            <p>Jensen’s motorsport rivalries were less prominent than those of Jaguar or Aston Martin, but its grand tourers competed against contemporaries like Bristol and Gordon-Keeble in reliability trials and rallies. The FF’s advanced technology gave it an edge in challenging conditions, earning respect among enthusiasts.</p>
            <p>The marque’s legacy lies in its engineering influence rather than extensive victories. The FF’s all-wheel-drive system inspired later rally and performance cars, and Jensen’s focus on road-going performance shaped British GT culture.</p>

            <h3>Unique and Unusual Trivia and Adventures</h3>
            <p>In 1964, a Jensen C-V8 was used by the British police in a high-speed chase trial, outpacing patrol cars due to its Chrysler V8 power. Another quirky tale involves a Jensen Interceptor abandoned in a Texas barn, rediscovered in the 1980s with a rattlesnake nest in its cabin, as recounted in enthusiast forums.</p>
            <p>Jensen’s commercial arm produced the quirky Jensen-Hawker bus in the 1940s, blending car and bus aesthetics. These oddities highlight Jensen’s versatility and cult appeal among collectors.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Impact and Media Presence</h3>
            <p>Jensen’s Interceptor gained fame in the 1970s TV series *The Protectors*, driven by character Paul Buchet, cementing its suave image.

            <p>Music stars and films like *The Man with the Golden Gun* (featuring a Jensen in a chase scene) amplified its cultural cachet. Jensen’s blend of luxury and performance made it a symbol of 1960s–1970s British cool.</p>

            <h3>Famous Owners</h3>

The Interceptor, with its Chrysler V8 and Italian-styled steel body, became the marque’s icon, offered in saloon, convertible, and coupé forms.</p>
            <p>Smaller models like the 1974 Jensen-Healey, a Lotus-engined roadster, aimed for affordability but faced reliability issues. Total production remained low, with around 6,400 Interceptors built, enhancing rarity.</p>

            <h3>Restoration Challenges and Techniques</h3>

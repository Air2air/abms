            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1922 as the Swallow Sidecar Company by William Lyons in Blackpool, Jaguar evolved into a premier British car manufacturer. Rebranded as S.S. Cars in 1933, it adopted the Jaguar name in 1945 to distance itself from wartime connotations. The XK120 (1948) and E-Type (1961) established Jaguar as a leader in sports cars, while saloons like the Mark VII (1950) and XJ6 (1968) defined luxury. By the 1980s, Jaguar faced financial struggles but was revitalized under Ford’s ownership from 1989.

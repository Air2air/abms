            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Triumph Automobiles, originating in 1885 as S. Bettmann & Co. in Coventry, began as a bicycle importer before producing motorcycles in 1902. The company entered the automotive market in 1923 with the Triumph 10/20, a 1.4-litre car designed by Lea-Francis. Renamed Triumph Motor Company in 1930, it focused on premium models like the Gloria and Southern Cross. Financial difficulties led to receivership in 1939, but Standard Motor Company acquired Triumph in 1944, reviving it with post-war models like the Roadster. The 1953 TR2 launched the iconic TR sports car series, cementing Triumph’s reputation. Acquired by Leyland Motors in 1960 and later British Leyland, Triumph produced cars until 1984, when the marque was discontinued. The Triumph Owners’ Club preserves its legacy. <a href="https://www.triumphownersclub.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Triumph Owners’ Club</a></p>

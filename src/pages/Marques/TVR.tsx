            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>TVR, founded in 1947 by Trevor Wilkinson in Blackpool as Trevcar Motors, began as an engineering workshop before building its first car in 1949. Renamed TVR Engineering, it pioneered lightweight sports cars with glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) bodies, starting with the 1958 Grantura. Known for powerful engines and visceral driving experiences, TVR produced iconic models like the Griffith, Tuscan, and Cerbera. Ownership changed hands—Martin Lilley (1965–1981), Peter Wheeler (1981–2004), and Nikolai Smolensky (2004–2013)—with production peaking in the 1990s as Britain’s largest independent sports car maker. Financial struggles led to a 2006 production halt, but TVR was revived in 2013, launching the Griffith II in 2017. The TVR Car Club preserves its legacy. <a href="https://www.tvr-car-club.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TVR Car Club</a></p>[](https://www.tvr-car-club.co.uk/tvr.html)
            <p>TVR’s raw, hand-built cars, emphasizing power and minimalism, earned a cult following among driving enthusiasts.</p>

            <h3>Engineering Innovations and Technical Milestones</h3>
            <p>TVR’s engineering focused on lightweight construction and potent engines. The 1958 Grantura introduced a GRP body on a tubular chassis, reducing weight to 635kg. The 1963 Griffith 200 paired a Ford 289 V8 with a Grantura chassis, achieving 0–60mph in 5 seconds. In 1983, the 350i adopted the Rover V8, delivering 190bhp. The 1994 Cerbera debuted TVR’s AJP8 engine, a 4.2-litre V8 producing 420bhp, designed by Al Melling. The 2000 Tuscan Speed Six used TVR’s 4-litre inline-six, offering 390bhp. TVR’s in-house production of over 85% of components ensured unique designs. The 1984 420 SEAC used a Kevlar-fibreglass composite body, enhancing rigidity. <a href="https://www.tvr.co.uk/heritage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TVR Heritage</a></p>[](https://www.tvr.co.uk/heritage)

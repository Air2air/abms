            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Land Rover’s story began in 1948, born from the vision of Maurice Wilks, Rover’s chief designer, who sketched a rugged vehicle inspired by the Willys Jeep on a Welsh beach. Launched at the Amsterdam Motor Show, the Series I was an instant hit, blending utilitarian design with unparalleled off-road capability. Initially designed for farmers and adventurers, its aluminum body and go-anywhere ethos made it a global icon. By the 1950s, Land Rover was synonymous with exploration, serving everyone from British farmers to African safari operators. The marque evolved through Series II and III, introducing refinements while retaining its core ruggedness. The 1970 Range Rover added luxury to the formula, creating the premium SUV segment. Land Rover’s commitment to durability and versatility cemented its place in British automotive history, with over 70% of all Land Rovers ever built still in use today, per enthusiast records.</p>
            <p>The marque’s growth mirrored Britain’s post-war recovery, with exports driving economic impact. Its utilitarian roots and royal patronage—Queen Elizabeth II famously drove Series models—elevated its cultural status.

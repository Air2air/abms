            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1898 by James Lansdowne Norton in Birmingham, Norton began as a bicycle parts manufacturer before producing its first motorcycle in 1902, powered by a Clément engine. The marque’s reputation for speed and durability grew with the 1907 Norton Energetic, and by the 1920s, Norton dominated racing with models like the CS1. Joining Associated Motorcycles (AMC) in 1953, Norton produced iconic bikes like the Manx and Commando, with over 250,000 units built by 1999, per <a href="https://www.nortonownersclub.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norton Owners Club</a>. Despite financial struggles and bankruptcy in 1977, Norton’s racing pedigree and raw character made it a British icon.</p>
            <p>The Commando’s revival in the 1980s and global fanbase, supported by clubs, kept Norton’s thunder alive, cementing its place in motorcycling history.</p>

            <h3>Engineering Innovations and Technical Milestones</h3>
            <p>Norton pioneered performance engineering. The 1927 CS1’s 490cc overhead-cam engine, designed by Walter Moore, delivered 30 hp, setting TT records.

The 1967 Commando’s 745cc parallel-twin introduced Isolastic rubber mounts, reducing vibration while producing 58 hp. The 1950 Dominator’s 497cc twin offered 31 hp, balancing road and race use. These advancements, detailed at <a href="https://www.cycleworld.com/story/motorcycle-reviews/norton-history-1970/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cycle World</a>, made Norton a benchmark for performance bikes.</p>

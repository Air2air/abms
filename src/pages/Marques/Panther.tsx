            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Panther Westwinds, founded in 1972 by Robert Jankel in Surrey, England, emerged as a bold, niche manufacturer of retro-styled sports and luxury cars. Jankel, a car enthusiast with a flair for customization, started the company in a small lock-up in Walton-on-Thames, building vehicles that blended classic aesthetics with contemporary engineering. Panther’s cars, often based on production car mechanicals, gained a cult following for their distinctive designs and craftsmanship. The company produced models like the J72, De Ville, and Kallista until 1990, navigating financial challenges and ownership changes, including acquisitions by Young Chull Kim and SsangYong. Despite its collapse in 1980 and subsequent revivals, Panther’s legacy endures among enthusiasts for its audacious vision. <a href="https://www.panthercarclub.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Panther Car Club</a> documents this vibrant history.</p>
            <p>Jankel’s passion for speed and style shaped Panther’s identity. His early exploits, like selling a customized Rolls-Royce to a Spanish bullfighter, set the tone for the marque’s eccentricity. Production later moved to Byfleet and Brooklands, with a final factory in Harlow, Essex, for the Kallista. Panther’s focus on bespoke, hand-built cars made it a standout in Britain’s automotive landscape, though limited production kept it a niche player.</p>

            <h3>Engineering Innovations and Technical Milestones</h3>
            <p>Panther’s engineering philosophy combined retro styling with innovative adaptations of existing platforms. The J72, inspired by the Jaguar SS100, used Jaguar’s 3.8L or 4.2L inline-six engines, paired with lightweight aluminum bodies for enhanced performance. The Panther 6, a six-wheeled convertible introduced in 1977, was a technical marvel, powered by a twin-turbo 8.2L Cadillac V8. Its unique six-wheel layout, inspired by the Tyrrell P34 Formula 1 car, featured two pairs of steerable front wheels, showcasing Panther’s willingness to push boundaries. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panther_6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Panther 6 Wikipedia</a> details this audacious design.</p>
            <p>Another milestone was the Panther Lima, which used Vauxhall mechanicals wrapped in a fiberglass body crafted by Industrial Marine Fibreglass. The later Kallista adopted a steel chassis and Ford engines, improving durability. Panther also experimented with a hovercraft in the late 1970s, using Honda Gold Wing motorcycle engines, though it never reached production. These efforts highlight Panther’s creative approach to engineering, blending practicality with bold experimentation.</p>

            <h3>Great Racing Achievements and Drivers</h3>
            <p>Panther Westwinds did not have a significant presence in competitive motorsport, focusing instead on road cars. However, its founder, Robert Jankel, was an avid racer in his youth, competing in amateur events that influenced Panther’s performance-oriented designs. The J72 and Panther 6, with their powerful engines, were built for spirited driving, appealing to enthusiasts who valued speed and handling. Some owners entered Panthers in club-level rallies and hill climbs, though no prominent drivers or major victories are documented.</p>
            <p>The lack of a formal racing program reflects Panther’s boutique nature, prioritizing craftsmanship over track dominance. Enthusiast accounts on forums like the Panther Car Club suggest occasional use in historic racing events post-1999, but during the 20th century, Panther’s legacy was rooted in road performance rather than circuit triumphs. This focus allowed Panther to carve a unique niche among British marques.</p>

            <h3>Racing Rivalries and Motorsport Legacy</h3>
            <p>Without a formal racing program, Panther had no direct rivalries with marques like Jaguar or Lotus in motorsport. Its closest competition was in the niche market of bespoke sports cars, where it rivaled firms like TVR and Morgan. These marques shared Panther’s emphasis on hand-built, characterful vehicles, appealing to buyers seeking alternatives to mass-produced cars. Panther’s J72, with its Jaguar-inspired styling, indirectly competed with Jaguar’s own heritage models, though it targeted a more exclusive audience.</p>
            <p>Panther’s motorsport legacy is subtle, tied to its influence on enthusiast culture. The Panther 6’s six-wheel design sparked discussions in automotive circles, drawing parallels to innovative racing experiments like the Tyrrell P34. While Panther never challenged for Le Mans or Formula 1 glory, its bold designs inspired a generation of custom car builders, cementing its place in Britain’s eclectic automotive history.</p>

            <h3>Unique and Unusual Trivia and Adventures</h3>
            <p>Panther’s history is filled with quirky tales. Robert Jankel once sold a customized Rolls-Royce to a Spanish bullfighter for £10,000, a story that epitomizes his flamboyant approach. The Panther 6, with only two built (one white, one black), became a legend for its six-wheel configuration and 600-horsepower engine, reportedly capable of 200 mph, though never officially tested. One Panther 6 resides in Saudi Arabia, while the other appeared at the 2015 Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este. <a href="https://www.supercars.net/blog/panther-westwinds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supercars.net</a> recounts this tale.</p>
            <p>Another oddity was Panther’s hovercraft project in the late 1970s, developed secretly in a Surrey barn using Honda Gold Wing engines. The project halted when the company collapsed in 1980, and the prototype’s fate remains unknown. These adventures underscore Panther’s penchant for the extraordinary, making it a favorite among collectors who relish its eccentricity.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Impact and Media Presence</h3>
            <p>Panther’s cultural footprint is modest but distinctive. The De Ville, a Rolls-Royce-inspired limousine, appeared in films and TV, including Disney’s “101 Dalmatians” (1996), where its opulent design suited villainous characters. The Panther 6 captured media attention at its 1977 launch, with outlets like Motor Sport Magazine marveling at its audacity. Panther’s cars, often featured in British car shows, became symbols of 1970s and 1980s excess, blending retro charm with modern excess.</p>
            <p>The marque’s niche appeal resonated with enthusiasts through publications like Classic & Sports Car, which praised its craftsmanship. Panther’s association with Brooklands, a historic racetrack, added to its mystique. While not a household name, Panther’s bold designs and Jankel’s larger-than-life persona ensured a lasting, if cult-like, presence in automotive culture.</p>

            <h3>Famous Owners</h3>
            <p>Specific records of famous Panther owners are scarce, reflecting the marque’s limited production and niche market. Some sources suggest high-profile figures in the 1970s and 1980s, such as musicians or minor royalty, owned models like the De Ville or J72, drawn to their exclusivity. The Panther Car Club notes that buyers often included wealthy eccentrics who valued bespoke craftsmanship, but names are rarely documented.</p>
            <p>The lack of confirmed celebrity owners does not diminish Panther’s allure. Its cars were status symbols for those seeking individuality, akin to bespoke tailoring. Enthusiast communities, rather than famous names, have kept Panther’s legacy alive, with owners proudly showcasing their cars at events like the NEC Classic Car Show.</p>

            <h3>Automobile and Motorcycle Models</h3>
            <p>Panther focused exclusively on automobiles, producing several iconic models. The J72 (1972–1986), a convertible styled after the Jaguar SS100, featured Jaguar engines and aluminum bodies, with around 376 built. The Rio (1975), based on the Triumph Dolomite, offered Rolls-Royce-like luxury at a high cost. The De Ville (1974–1985), a limousine with classic styling, used V12 Jaguar engines. The Lima (1976–1982) was a fiberglass-bodied roadster with Vauxhall components, later replaced by the Kallista (1983–1990), which used Ford mechanics and a steel chassis.</p>
            <p>The Panther 6 (1977) was the marque’s most radical offering, a six-wheeled convertible with a twin-turbo Cadillac V8. The Solo (1989–1990), a modern four-wheel-drive sports car, marked Panther’s final model, with production halted by SsangYong. Each model reflected Panther’s blend of retro aesthetics and innovative engineering, appealing to a select audience.</p>

            <h3>Restoration Challenges and Techniques</h3>
            <p>Restoring Panther cars presents unique challenges due to their bespoke construction and limited production.

The Panther 6’s complex six-wheel setup demands rare Pirelli tires and custom suspension parts, often requiring fabrication.</p>
            <p>Techniques include using original blueprints from the Panther Car Club for accuracy and 3D printing for small components. Restorers often consult with former Panther engineers for guidance. The Kallista’s steel chassis requires rust prevention, while aluminum-bodied J72s need careful polishing to avoid corrosion. These challenges make Panther <Link to="/restoration">restoration</Link> a labor of love, rewarding enthusiasts with unique showpieces.</p>

            <h3>Global Influence and Export Success</h3>
            <p>Panther’s global influence was limited but notable among niche markets. The marque exported cars to the Middle East, North America, and Asia, with the De Ville and Panther 6 attracting buyers in Saudi Arabia and the U.S. The Kallista found success in Europe, particularly Germany, due to its Ford-based reliability. Export figures are modest, with production totaling fewer than 2,000 cars, but Panther’s bold designs garnered international attention at shows like the Geneva Motor Show.</p>
            <p>The Jindo Corporation’s involvement in the 1980s, producing Kallista components in South Korea, marked a rare instance of British-Asian collaboration. Panther’s influence lies in its inspiration to small-scale manufacturers worldwide, proving that bespoke cars could compete with mass-market brands. Its rarity abroad enhances its mystique among global collectors.</p>

            <h3>Status Among Collectors Today and Place in History</h3>
            <p>Today, Panther cars are prized by collectors for their rarity and eccentricity. Models like the J72 and Panther 6 command high prices at auctions, often exceeding £50,000, due to their limited production and unique designs. The Panther Car Club supports an active community, organizing events and providing <Link to="/restoration">restoration</Link> resources. Panther’s place in history is as a bold outlier, embodying Britain’s tradition of quirky, hand-built cars alongside marques like Morgan.</p>

            <h3>Standout Models That Made the Marque Great</h3>

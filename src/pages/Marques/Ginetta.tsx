            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1958 by brothers Bob, Ivor, Trevers, and Douglas Walklett in Woodbridge, Suffolk, Ginetta Cars Limited began with the G1, a one-off based on a Wolseley Hornet. The G2 (1958), a Ford-based kit car, marked their first production model, followed by the iconic G4 (1961), a lightweight sports car for road and track. Moving to Witham, Essex, in 1962, Ginetta expanded, producing models like the G15 and G21. Sold to Martin Phaff in 1989, the company faced challenges but persisted with the G33. Acquired by Lawrence Tomlinson in 2005, Ginetta relocated to Leeds, per <a href="https://www.ginetta.com/en/about-ginetta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ginetta Official</a>.</p>

            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1861 as the Birmingham Small Arms Company, BSA began producing motorcycles in 1903, becoming Britain’s largest manufacturer by the 1950s. Based in Small Heath, Birmingham, BSA’s early models used proprietary and White & Poppe engines, evolving into iconic bikes like the B31 (1945) and A10 Gold Flash (1950). The 1960s saw the legendary A65 Star and Gold Star, but financial struggles and competition from Japanese marques led to a merger with Norton-Villiers in 1973, ending BSA’s motorcycle production, per <a href="https://www.bsafactoryrecords.com/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BSA Factory Records</a>.</p>
            <p>BSA’s legacy of quality and performance endures, celebrated by enthusiasts at vintage rallies.</p>

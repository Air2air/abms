            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Sunbeam, established in 1888 by John Marston in Wolverhampton, began as a bicycle manufacturer before producing its first car in 1901 and motorcycles in 1912. Known for quality engineering, Sunbeam became a prominent British marque, excelling in both automotive and motorcycle sectors. The 1920s and 1930s were its golden era, with cars like the 3-Litre and motorcycles like the Model 90 earning acclaim for performance. Sunbeam’s racing successes, including Grand Prix wins, elevated its status. Acquired by Rootes Group in 1935, car production declined post-World War II, ceasing by 1967, while motorcycle production ended in 1939. The marque’s legacy endures through the Sunbeam Owners’ Club, celebrating its contributions to British motoring. <a href="https://www.sunbeam.org.uk/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sunbeam Owners’ Club</a></p>

            <h3>Engineering Innovations and Technical Milestones</h3>
            <p>Sunbeam pioneered several engineering advancements. Its 1912 12/16 car featured a four-cylinder engine with overhead valves, improving efficiency. The 1923 3-Litre Super Sports introduced twin overhead camshafts (DOHC), a rarity for road cars, enhancing power. In motorcycles, the 1927 Model 90 used a 500cc single-cylinder with dry-sump lubrication, boosting reliability. Sunbeam’s 1930 six-wheel experimental car explored novel chassis designs, though it remained a prototype. The 1934 Speed Twenty’s independent front suspension improved handling. Motorcycle innovations included the 1914 saddle tank, streamlining design. <a href="https://www.classicmotor.co.uk/sunbeam-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classic Motor: Sunbeam</a></p>

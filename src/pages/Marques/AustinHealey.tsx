            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Launched in 1952 through a partnership between the Austin division of the British Motor Corporation (BMC) and the Donald Healey Motor Company, Austin-Healey became synonymous with British sports car flair. Founded by Donald Healey, a former rally driver, the marque debuted the Healey 100 at the 1952 London Motor Show, captivating audiences with its sleek design and performance. The iconic 100, Sprite, and 3000 models defined the brand, with over 70,000 cars produced by 1972. Austin-Healey’s blend of affordability and spirited driving made it a favorite among enthusiasts, celebrated at events like the <a href="https://allbritishmotorshow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All British Motor Show</a>.</p>
            <p>The marque’s success stemmed from Healey’s engineering and BMC’s production muscle. Despite ceasing production in 1972 due to emissions regulations and corporate shifts, Austin-Healey’s legacy endures through vibrant enthusiast clubs and vintage rallies.</p>

            <h3>Engineering Innovations and Technical Milestones</h3>

Its 1964 Mk III variant featured a 150 bhp engine, servo-assisted brakes, and improved suspension with radius arms, enhancing handling.</p>
            <p>The 1958 Sprite, nicknamed “Frogeye” for its distinctive headlights, used a 948cc A-Series engine and unitary construction, making it nimble and affordable. Innovations like the 100-6’s six-cylinder engine and the Sprite’s rack-and-pinion steering set benchmarks for accessible performance, influencing later sports cars.</p>

A modified 3000, the Big Healey Streamliner, hit 192 mph at Bonneville in 1971, piloted by Donald Healey’s son, Brian. During a 1960s rally, a Sprite’s spare tire was used as a makeshift bumper to finish the race.</p>

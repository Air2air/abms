            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>McLaren was founded in 1963 by Bruce McLaren, a New Zealand racer whose vision for lightweight, driver-focused cars reshaped motorsport and road car design. Starting with the M1A, McLaren quickly dominated Can-Am racing, leading to Formula 1 entry in 1966. The marque’s first road car, the 1992 F1, redefined supercars with its carbon-fiber monocoque and central driving position. Based in Woking, Surrey, McLaren grew from a racing outfit to a dual-force in F1 and road cars, blending British precision with innovation. By 1999, McLaren had secured eight F1 Constructors’ Championships and a legacy of performance, detailed at <a href="https://www.mclaren.com/racing/heritage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McLaren Heritage</a>.</p>
            <p>Despite financial challenges, McLaren’s commitment to engineering excellence and racing pedigree made it a revered name among enthusiasts, with its road cars embodying track-honed technology.</p>

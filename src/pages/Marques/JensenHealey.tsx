            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Launched in 1972 by Jensen Motors Ltd. in West Bromwich, the Jensen-Healey was a two-seater convertible sports car developed with Donald Healey to replace the Austin-Healey 3000. After British Leyland ended Austin-Healey production in 1967, Kjell Qvale, a major US dealer, became Jensen’s majority shareholder, appointing Donald Healey as chairman. The car, designed by Hugo Poole and later refined by William Towns, aimed to compete between the Triumph TR6 and Jaguar E-Type. A fastback Jensen GT followed in 1975. Production ceased in 1976 due to financial difficulties, exacerbated by the oil crisis and labor issues, with 10,503 units built, per <a href="https://www.jaguarheritage.com/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaguar Heritage</a>.</p>[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen-Healey)
            <p>Jensen-Healey’s blend of style and performance remains a niche classic.</p>

            <h3>Engineering Innovations and Technical Milestones</h3>
            <p>The Jensen-Healey featured a Lotus 907 2.0-liter, 16-valve, twin-cam engine, the first mass-produced multi-valve engine, delivering 144 bhp. Its steel unibody construction, designed by Barry Bilbie, used bolt-on panels for easy repairs. Suspension included double wishbone with coil springs at the front and a live rear axle with trailing arms, adapted from Vauxhall Firenza. The Mark I (1972–73) used a Chrysler four-speed gearbox, while the Mark II (1973–75) adopted a Getrag five-speed close-ratio unit, per <a href="https://www.nationalmotormuseum.co.uk/vehicle-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Motor Museum</a>.</p>[](https://www.austinhealeyclub.com/pages/jensenhealeys.html)
            <p>Despite early engine reliability issues, these innovations marked Jensen-Healey as a forward-thinking sports car.</p>

            <h3>Great Racing Achievements and Drivers</h3>
            <p>Jensen-Healey dominated the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) D Production Championship, winning in 1973, its debut year, and securing five titles overall, a rare feat. Lee Mueller and Jonathan Woodner drove in 1973, with Mueller winning again in 1974. Huffaker Engineering’s factory team led these efforts, and West Coast dealers supported a late 1975 campaign, per <a href="https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motorsport Magazine</a>.</p>[](https://silodrome.com/jensen-healey/)

            <h3>Unique and Unusual Trivia and Adventures</h3>
            <p>Early Jensen-Healeys lacked a passenger-side door lock, quickly added in 1973. A 1972 prototype was tested by Donald Healey himself, navigating Welsh rally roads to refine handling. The Jensen GT’s paisley-patterned seats, introduced in 1975, became a quirky 1970s hallmark. A 1974 Mark II was driven across Europe for a Jensen Owners’ Club rally, showcasing reliability, per <a href="https://www.classicandsportscar.com/features/jensen-healey-righting-wrongs-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classic & Sports Car</a>.</p>[](https://www.classicandsportscar.com/features/jensen-healey-righting-wrongs-history)

            <h3>Cultural Impact and Media Presence</h3>
            <p>Jensen-Healey appeared in 1970s motoring press, with *Road & Track* praising its performance despite styling critiques. It featured on BBC’s *Top Gear* in 1990, tested by Tiff Needell, and Jeremy Clarkson drove one in a later episode, per <a href="https://www.silodrome.com/jensen-gt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silodrome</a>. Its sleek design resonated with enthusiasts, though it never matched the Austin-Healey’s fame.</p>[](https://silodrome.com/a-rare-jensen-gt-the-lotus-powered-shooting-brake-from-england/)

            <h3>Automobile and Motorcycle Models</h3>
            <p>Jensen-Healey produced only automobiles: the Mark I (1972–73, 3,356 units, VIN 10,000–13,349), Mark II and JH5 (1973–75, 7,142 units, VIN 13,500–20,504), and Jensen GT (1975–76, 509 units, VIN 30,000–30,510). All used the Lotus 907 engine, with Mark I featuring a four-speed gearbox and Mark II/JH5 a five-speed. The GT was a 2+2 fastback, per <a href="https://www.austinhealeyclub.com/jensen-healeys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Austin Healey Club</a>.</p>[](https://www.austinhealeyclub.com/pages/jensenhealeys.html)

            <h3>Restoration Challenges and Techniques</h3>
            <p>Restoring Jensen-Healeys is challenging due to rust in steel unibodies, particularly in UK climates. Early Lotus 907 engines suffered oil leaks and timing belt issues, requiring upgraded gaskets. Vauxhall-sourced suspension parts are available, but body panels rely on Martin Robey reproductions. Restorers use MIG welding and epoxy primers, guided by Jensen Owners’ Club resources, per <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/jensen/100917/jensen-healey-buying-guide-and-review-1972-1976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auto Express</a>.</p>[](https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/classic-cars/104986/jensen-healey-buying-guide-and-review-1972-1976)

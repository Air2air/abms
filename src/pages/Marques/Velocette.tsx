            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Velocette, founded in 1905 by Johannes Gütgemann (later John Goodman) and William Gue as Taylor, Gue Ltd. in Birmingham, began with the Veloce, a 2hp motorcycle. Renamed Veloce Ltd., it adopted the Velocette name in 1913 for its lightweight two-stroke, which became synonymous with quality. A family-run firm, Velocette produced hand-built motorcycles, competing with giants like BSA and Triumph. Renowned for innovation, it excelled in racing from the 1920s to 1950s, securing two 350cc World Championships (1949–1950) and a 24-hour 100mph record in 1961. Financial struggles and Japanese competition led to its closure in 1971. The Velocette Owners’ Club preserves its legacy. <a href="https://www.velocetteowners.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Velocette Owners’ Club</a></p>[](https://www.velocetteowners.com/)
            <p>Velocette’s commitment to craftsmanship and performance earned it a devoted following among enthusiasts and racers.</p>

            <h3>Engineering Innovations and Technical Milestones</h3>
            <p>Velocette pioneered numerous advancements. The 1925 K-series introduced a 349cc overhead-camshaft (OHC) engine, with the 1929 KTT featuring the first positive-stop foot gearchange. The 1930 GTP two-stroke used throttle-controlled oil injection, a world first. In 1933, the MOV 250cc overhead-valve (OHV) engine offered 78mph performance, followed by the 1934 MAC 350cc and 1935 MSS 500cc. The 1936 MAC adopted telescopic forks, and 1953 models added swingarm suspension. The 1956 Venom and Viper introduced high-performance 500cc and 350cc singles, with the 1961 Venom setting a 24-hour 100.05mph record. <a href="https://www.velocetteclassics.com/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Velocette Classics</a></p>[](https://www.velocetteclassics.com/velo_history.html)

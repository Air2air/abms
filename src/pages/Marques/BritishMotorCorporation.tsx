            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Formed in 1952 through the merger of Austin and Morris, the British Motor Corporation (BMC) became Britain’s largest car manufacturer, producing over 1.5 million vehicles by 1968. Based in Longbridge, Birmingham, BMC unified marques like Austin, Morris, MG, Riley, and Wolseley, and collaborated with Donald Healey for Austin-Healey sports cars. Iconic models like the Mini, Austin-Healey 3000, and Morris Minor defined its era. BMC’s focus on affordable, innovative cars shaped mass motoring, celebrated at events like the <a href="https://allbritishmotorshow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All British Motor Show</a>.</p>
            <p>Despite its success, BMC faced challenges from labor disputes and competition, merging into British Leyland in 1968. Its legacy endures through enduring models and enthusiast communities worldwide.</p>

            <h3>Engineering Innovations and Technical Milestones</h3>
            <p>BMC revolutionized car design with the 1959 Mini, engineered by Alec Issigonis, featuring a transverse engine and front-wheel drive, maximizing space in a 10-foot car. The 1963 1100/1300 series introduced Hydrolastic suspension for superior ride quality. The Austin-Healey 100’s 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine, paired with a lightweight chassis, delivered 90 bhp, setting sports car standards. The Morris Minor’s 1948 monocoque construction improved rigidity.</p>
            <p>BMC’s A-Series engine, used in Minis and Sprites, evolved from 848cc to 1.3 liters, powering diverse models. These innovations, prioritizing efficiency and versatility, influenced global compact car design, from Fiats to Hondas.</p>

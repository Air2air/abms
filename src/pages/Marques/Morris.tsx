            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1913 by William Morris in Oxford, the Morris Motor Company began with the iconic Morris Oxford, a car designed to bring reliable transport to the masses. From its Cowley factory, Morris became Britain’s largest car manufacturer by the 1920s, producing over 100,000 vehicles annually by 1925. The 1927 Morris Minor and 1938 Morris 8 solidified its reputation for affordable, practical cars. Merging with Austin in 1952 to form the British Motor Corporation (BMC), Morris contributed to classics like the Mini. By 1999, over 3 million Morris-badged cars had been built, per <a href="https://www.aronline.co.uk/cars/morris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AROnline</a>. The marque faded as BMC prioritized other brands, but its legacy endures.</p>
            <p>Morris’ focus on economy and reliability made it a household name, with its cars shaping Britain’s post-war mobility and industrial might.</p>

            <h3>Engineering Innovations and Technical Milestones</h3>
            <p>Morris pioneered mass production in Britain, adopting Ford-inspired assembly lines for the 1913 Oxford, reducing costs. The 1927 Minor’s 847cc side-valve engine delivered 20 hp, ideal for urban driving. The 1938 Morris 8’s 918cc engine and synchromesh gearbox improved efficiency and ease of use. The 1948 Morris Minor, designed by Alec Issigonis, introduced a monocoque chassis and torsion-bar suspension, enhancing handling at 1,600 pounds. The 1956 Morris Isis’ 2.6-liter six-cylinder engine offered family-car power. These advancements, detailed at <a href="https://www.morrisregister.co.uk/history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morris Register</a>, set standards for affordability.</p>

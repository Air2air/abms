            <h3>Overall History</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1901 by John Weller and John Portwine as the Weller Brothers in London, AC Cars, originally Auto Carriers Ltd., began producing three-wheeled delivery vehicles in West Norwood. By 1911, renamed AC Ltd., the company moved to Thames Ditton, Surrey, focusing on lightweight sports cars. The 1920s saw steady growth with models like the AC Six, but financial struggles led to multiple ownership changes, including the Hurlock brothers’ acquisition in 1930. AC Cars gained fame with the Ace and Cobra in the 1950s–1960s, the latter developed with Carroll Shelby. Production slowed in the 1980s, with brief revivals under Brian Angliss. By 1999, AC Cars was a niche producer, known for bespoke sports cars, with its Thames Ditton factory central to its legacy until partial relocation in the 1990s.</p>
            <p>The marque’s name, derived from "Auto Carriers," reflected its early utility focus, but its pivot to performance cars defined its British identity. Despite challenges, AC Cars’ resilience made it one of Britain’s oldest independent carmakers by the 20th century’s end.</p>

            <h3>Engineering Innovations and Technical Milestones</h3>
            <p>AC Cars pioneered lightweight construction, with the 1919 AC Six introducing a 1.5L six-cylinder engine with an aluminum block, a rarity for its time. The 1953 Ace featured a tubular steel chassis and independent suspension, enhancing handling and inspiring the Cobra’s design. The 1962 AC Cobra’s marriage of a lightweight Ace chassis with a Ford V8 engine, producing up to 425 bhp, set a benchmark for power-to-weight ratios, achieving 0–60 mph in under 4.5 seconds. AC’s early adoption of disc brakes on the Aceca in 1957 improved stopping power, a technology later standard in performance cars.</p>
            <p>The company’s bespoke approach allowed for custom engine tuning, as seen in the 1927 AC Royal’s overhead-cam engine, which offered 40 bhp from 1.5L. These innovations, verified by period *Autocar* reviews, positioned AC Cars as a leader in sports car engineering.</p>

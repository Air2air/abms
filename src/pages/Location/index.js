      The Blackhawk Museum is located in the Bay Area&rsquo;s Tri-Valley on the
      eastern side of the San Francisco Bay Hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less than an hour from San Francisco and San Jose, the Tri-Valley provides
      many opportunities for an entertaining day out. The Livermore wine growing
      region is less than a half an hour to the south and the Museum sits in the
      shadow of Mt. Diablo State Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the Museum is located at the end of one of the most beautiful
      shopping centers in the East Bay, the Blackhawk Plaza, an assortment of
      boutiques, restaurants, galleries and many other shops. With a stream
      running through it&rsquo;s manicured landscaping, from the fountain atop
      the Museum&rsquo;s plaza to the outdoor terrace of the Blackhawk Grille,
      the Plaza provides a unique shopping experience.
